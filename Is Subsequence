Explanation of the "Is Subsequence" Problem and Solutions
Introduction & Problem Statement
Given two strings, s and t, the challenge is to determine if s is a subsequence of t. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

Key Concepts:
What Makes This Problem Unique?
String Constraints:

The length of s can range from 0 to 100.
The length of t can vary between 0 and 10,000.
Both s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
Solution Techniques:
This problem can be approached using various techniques, including iterative (two-pointers) methods and dynamic programming.
